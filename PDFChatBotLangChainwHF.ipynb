        "In this project, I built a research paper chatbot using LangChain and Hugging Face to interact with the seminal paper \"Attention is All You Need\". The system parses the PDF using PyPDFLoader, splits it into chunks, generates semantic embeddings with sentence-transformers, and stores them in a FAISS vector database. The chatbot is powered by HuggingFace’s Mistral-7B-Instruct model via hosted inference, enabling natural language question answering. LangChain’s conversational memory ensures coherent multi-turn dialogue, making this chatbot a practical tool for deeply exploring complex research papers through an interactive Q&A experience—all running entirely on Google Colab.\n",
