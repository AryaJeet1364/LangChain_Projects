        "In this project, I built a modular GenAI pipeline using LangChain and Hugging Face's Mistral-7B-Instruct model via hosted inference. I explored LangChainâ€™s core components including PromptTemplate, LLMChain, SimpleSequentialChain, SequentialChain, and custom tool-based agents. By chaining prompts, I enabled multi-step reasoning, tool usage, and structured output generation.\n",
